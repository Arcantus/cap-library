Common Alerting Protocol Library [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/cap-library.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/cap-library)
===========

The CAP Library is a collection of code and tools to work with public alerting messages in the [Common Alerting Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol) format.

Namely, a well-tested and easy-to-use Java library that supports
* creation and parsing of feeds in the CAP format,
* validating of feeds against common CAP profiles.

Moreover, it includes a simple [web application](http://cap-validator.appspot.com/) to validate the correctness of CAP messages.
