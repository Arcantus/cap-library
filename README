Usage
=====
The CAP Library is designed to support CAP versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2.
There are classes that can parse XML CAP messages as well as easily
create new messages and write them to XML, JSON, (soon) ASN.1, and (soon) KML.

The main data structures are auto-generated from a Google protocol
buffer implementation of the CAP spec in proto/cap.proto. Protocol buffers 
are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for
serializing structured data - think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler.

The generated classes offer a clean API for creating and manipulating
alert objects. The alert data structures are immutable; they provide only
getters.  New alerts are constructed via Builder classes. See 
javatests/com/google/publicalerts/cap/TestUtil.java for an example.

javatests/com/google/publicalerts/cap/EndToEndTest.java provides a good
overview of how to get started using the library.
